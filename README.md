Go to the green button saying `Code` and click on it then, Copy the URL
```bash
git clone "paste the URL here"
```
Cloning will begin

## Change Directory
Once, the repo is cloned, then:
```bash
cd Open-Source-Planet
```
then,
## Create a Branch
```bash
git switch -c "name_of_your_branch"
```
instead of `name_of_your_branch` write the name of the branch whatever you want
## Make Changes to the File
```bash
vi addname.txt
```
Add this at the end of the addname.txt file: 
```bash
Hi! I am <your_name> and my GitHub profile is [username](profile_link)
```

Here, Replace:
- `<your_name>` with your actual name
- `username` with your actual GitHub Username
- `profile_link` with your GitHub profile's link
to save the changes and exit the file at the same time, press `esc` on your keyboard and then type `:wq` and hit enter! 
then,

## Add the changes
Add the changes:
Currently, if you do 
```bash

So, do this:
```bash
git add addname.txt

Now, You'll be able to see that your branch is ahead of origin/main by 1 commit

## Push your changes to your branch

To push your changes to your branch which you created
```bash
git push -u origin your_branch_name
```
here, replace `your_branch_name` with the name of your branch which you created
